# linux-env

My own Linux environment bash startup script configuration.  Specific to me and my current MacOSX environment though not much should prevent it from being used on an Ubuntu platform AFAIK.  Not tested yet though.

* git-prompt
* mostly driven from `/etc/bashrc`
* Setup completion separately using your platform's package manager
